# AutoRPM2PARK
Automatically creates a parking permit on rpm2park.com,
saves a screenshot of the permit to the PC,
sends the screenshot in a discord channel,
and auto-renews the permit when it's about to expire.

The screenshot, discord, and auto-renewal settings are all
boolean flags in the config.yaml to decide which features
you want to use or avoid.

This project was inspired by a $200 towing fee after there was a
3 hour gap between two of my parking permits, and I was towed.
